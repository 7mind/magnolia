# Magnolia

Magnolia is a generic macro for automatic derivation of typeclasses for
datatypes composed from case classes and sealed traits. It supports
recursively-defined datatypes out-of-the-box, and incurs no significant
time-penalty during compilation. If derivation fails, error messages are
detailed and informative.

Please see the [Magnolia](http://magnolia.work/) website for more information.
